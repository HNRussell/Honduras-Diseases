# Honduras-Diseases

## Overview

Welcome to my final project!

Part of my job as an Army public health officer is to educate Soldiers, DoD civilians and coalition forces of what medical and environmental health threats exist in certain AOs. For my final project, my intent was to create a map of Honduras that demonstrates the top two or three vector-borne diseases present and how prevalent they are within each of the regions/provinces. Data and layer resources will be derived from the sources below:

Country Outlines: https://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/support/downloads/shapefiles.html

Disease and Vector Data:

Defense Health Agency | https://www.health.mil/About-MHS/OASDHA/Defense-Health-Agency

Central American Refugee Health Profile | https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/profiles/central-american/index.html

My final submission will be a web page that includes a static map as image (PNG or JPG format). I created a new repository for this project, published it via GitHub Pages, am working to create a detailed README.md file, and made my instructor a collaborator.
