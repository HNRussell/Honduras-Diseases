# Honduras-Diseases

## Overview

Welcome to my final project for MAP 671-201 (Fall 2022) - Malaria Distribution in Honduras (2019)

Part of my job as an Army public health officer is to educate Soldiers, DoD civilians and oalition forces of what medical and environmental health threats exist in certain Areas of Operation (AO). For my final project, my intent was to create a map of Honduras that demonstrates the prevalence of malaria in each province of Honduras. I also overlaid the freshwater sources within the country as possible breeding grounds for these vectors to determine if there is a correlation between these natural ecological areas and presence of malaria species/cases. My overall intent is to use this data to brief to Servicemembers of potential exposure before they enter that AO in order to highlight the importance of chemoprophylaxis and PPE use while in country. Data and layer resources were derived from the sources below:

World and Country Data: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/, https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/, 

Disease and Vector Data:

World Health Organization, Global Health Organization (CSV file): https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-malaria-en.html

Defense Health Agency | https://www.health.mil/About-MHS/OASDHA/Defense-Health-Agency

My final submission will be a web page that includes a static map as image (PNG format) using EPSG: 3857, Scale 1:3238287, utilizing QGIS 3.26.3.
