## Chikungunya Case Numbers in Central America by Country (2021-2022)

Welcome to my final project for MAP 671-201 (Fall 2022)!

Part of my job as an military public health officer is to educate Service Members, DoD civilians and coalition forces of what medical and environmental health threats exist in certain Areas of Operation (AO). For my final project, my intent was to create a map that demonstrated the incidence of Chikungunya in each of the eight Central American countries using data reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO).

Chikungunya is spread by mosquitoes such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus and is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in Central America. My overall intent is to use this data to brief to Servicemembers of potential exposure before they enter that AO in order to highlight the importance of proper uniform wear and use of PPE while in country. Datasets and layer files were dervied from the sources listed below from January 2021 through November 2022: 

World and Country Data: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/ & https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/

Disease and Vector Data (CSV): https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/chikv-en.html 

My final submission includes a static, choropleth map (as image in PNG format) utilizing QGIS 3.26.3 (EPSG: 4326, scale 1:14741071). Legend includes country outlines, oceans, and Chikungunya incidence numbers collected from PAHO and WHO.
