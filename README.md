## Chikungunya Case Numbers in Central America by Country (2021-2022)

Welcome to my final project for MAP 671-201 (Fall 2022)!

Part of my job as an military public health officer is to educate Service Members, DoD civilians and Coalition Forces about what medical and environmental health threats exist in certain Areas of Operation (AO). For my final project, my intent was to create a map that demonstrated the incidence of Chikungunya in each of the eight Central American countries using data reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and World Health Organization (WHO).

Chikungunya is spread by mosquito species such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, and is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in Central America. Although rarely lethal, exposure to this viral disease can lead to months or even years of physical pain and disability. This dataset and the map layers utilized allowed me to create a visual to demonstrate to Service Members the potential for exposure to the disease while in the Central American AO. This will assist military medical professionals and leaders in highlighting the importance of proper uniform wear and use of PPE while on missions and during day-to-day operations. 

My final map submission includes a static, choropleth map (as image in PNG format) utilizing QGIS 3.26.3 (EPSG: 4326, scale 1:14741071). Legend includes country outlines, oceans, and Chikungunya incidence numbers collected from PAHO and WHO.

Datasets and layer files were dervied from the sources listed below from January 2021 through November 2022: 

World and Country Data: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/ & https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/

Disease and Vector Data (CSV): https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/chikv-en.html 

The map indicates low incidence rates (less than 50) in all countries except Guatemala and El Salvador. The reason for this is not known, but poverty and lack of education in those areas could be contributing factors. During the research and mapping process, I had originally planned to look into several diseases endemic to Central America or one specific country (down to the province) to discover which was most prevalent in each country, but discovered a lack a of datasets (current or altogether) to be used. This is something that during future missions I hope to change!
