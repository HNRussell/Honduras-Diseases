## Overview

Welcome to my final project for MAP 671-201 (Fall 2022) - Chikungunya Distribution in Central America (2021-2022)

Part of my job as an Army public health officer is to educate Soldiers, DoD civilians and oalition forces of what medical and environmental health threats exist in certain Areas of Operation (AO). For my final project, my intent was to create a map of Central America that demonstrates the incidence of Chikungunya in each country within that region of the world using data reported by each country in 2021 through November 2022. Chikungunya is spread by mosquitoes and is one of the most common vector-borne diseases in Central America. My overall intent is to use this data to brief to Servicemembers of potential exposure before they enter that AO in order to highlight the importance of chemoprophylaxia and PPE use. Data and layer resources were derived from the sources below:

World and Country Data: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/, https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/, 

Disease and Vector Data (CSV): https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/chikv-en.html 

My final submission will be a web page that includes a static map as image (PNG format) using EPSG: 3857, Scale 1:3238287, utilizing QGIS 3.26.3. Legend will include country outlines, oceans, and Chikungunya incidence.
