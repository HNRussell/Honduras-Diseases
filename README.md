# Honduras-Diseases

## Overview

Welcome to my final project!

Part of my job as an Army public health officer is to educate Soldiers, DoD civilians and coalition forces of what medical and environmental health threats exist in certain AOs. For my final project, I intend to create a map of Honduras that demonstrates the top two or three vector-borne diseases present and how prevalent they are within each of the regions/provinces. I may create a separate map for each disease and have them displayed together on one print layout. Data and layer resources will be derived from the sources below:



My submission will be a web page that includes a static map as image (PNG or JPG format). I created a new repository for this project, published it via GitHub Pages, am working to create a detailed README.md file, and made my instructor a collaborator.
