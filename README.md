# Honduras-Diseases

## Overview

Welcome to my final project for MAP 671-201 - TITLE OF MAP TBD

Part of my job as an Army public health officer is to educate Soldiers, DoD civilians and oalition forces of what medical and environmental health threats exist in certain Areas of Operation (AO). For my final project, my intent was to create a map of Honduras that demonstrates the top vector-borne diseases present and how prevalent they are within each of the regions/provinces in that country to brief to Servicemembers before they enter that AO. Data and layer resources were derived from the sources below:

World and Country Data: http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/

Disease and Vector Data:

Defense Health Agency | https://www.health.mil/About-MHS/OASDHA/Defense-Health-Agency

Central American Refugee Health Profile | https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/profiles/central-american/index.html

My final submission will be a web page that includes a static map as image (PNG format). I created a new repository for this project, published it via GitHub Pages, am working to create a detailed README.md file, and made my instructor a collaborator.
